‚ñ∫ Problem Statement
E-commerce companies lose billions of dollars annually to refund fraud, where customers claim an item was damaged or not received to get a refund while keeping the product. Traditional fraud systems, which often rely only on historical transaction data, struggle to understand the full context of a claim, leading to significant financial loss and operational inefficiency.

How can we build an AI smart enough to analyze multiple, diverse forms of evidence‚Äîlike a human detective‚Äîto make a fair and accurate judgment in real-time?

‚ñ∫ Our Solution: The Aegis System
Aegis is a proof-of-concept, multi-modal AI system designed to proactively detect and mitigate e-commerce refund fraud. Instead of relying on a single model, Aegis acts as a complete investigation unit, deploying a team of three specialized AI "experts" that collaborate to build a case file on every refund request.

‚ñ∫ Key Features
Multi-Modal Analysis: Fuses insights from three different data types: tabular (user history), text (complaint messages), and images (photographic evidence).

Real-time Risk Scoring: Generates an instant, data-driven "Fraud Risk Score" for every refund request.

Explainable AI (XAI): The application provides an "Evidence Breakdown," explaining why the AI reached its conclusion, empowering human agents to make informed decisions.

Interactive Application: A user-friendly web app built with Streamlit to demonstrate the system's capabilities live.

‚ñ∫ How It Works: The AI Detective Team
üß† The Analyst (XGBoost Model): A custom-trained XGBoost model acts as a profiler. It digs into historical and transactional data (account age, past refund behavior, order price) to spot suspicious numerical patterns.

üó£Ô∏è The Interrogator (Hugging Face NLP): This expert reads the customer's story. By integrating a pre-trained DistilBERT Transformer, it performs deep sentiment analysis to understand the emotional tone and linguistic patterns that can indicate deception.

üëÅÔ∏è The Forensics Expert (Hugging Face Vision): This model analyzes the customer's photographic "proof." It uses a DETR Vision Transformer to perform object detection, verifying if the item in the photo even matches the product that was ordered.

These three expert opinions are combined into a final, highly accurate risk score.
